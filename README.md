# ACSE_compiler
ACSE (Advanced Compiler System for Education) is a simple compiler developed for educational purpose as a tool for the “Formal Languages and Compilers” course at Politecnico di Milano.


ACSE is able to translate a source code written in LanCE 1.3 (Language for Compilers Education) into an assembly for the MACE architecture.

-------------------------------
how to compile and run new Lance programs.
TERMINAL:

make clean

make (To install the ACSE compiler type in the console)

make tests (To compile some examples (located in the directory ./tests))

./bin/mace ./tests/special/special.o  

-------------------------------
EXERCISE 

int a[10];
int b = 16; //16 in binary is 10000 so the least significant 1 is in 4th position -> we access the 4th element in the array
/* a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] */

int u= (arr ??? val);
write(u); 
/*5*/
